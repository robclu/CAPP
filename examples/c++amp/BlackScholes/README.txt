Black-Scholes option pricing

-Overview:
The most common definition of an option is an agreement between two parties, the option seller and the option buyer, whereby the option buyer is granted a right (but not an obligation), secured by the option seller, to carry out some operation (or exercise the option) at some moment in the future. The predetermined price is referred to as the strike price, and the future date is called the expiration date.
Options come in several varieties:
A call option grants its holder the right to buy the underlying asset at a strike price at some moment in the future.
A put option gives its holder the right to sell the underlying asset at a strike price at some moment in the future.
There are several types of options, mostly depending on when the option can be exercised. European options can be exercised only on the expiration date. American-style options are more flexible as they may be exercised at any time up to and including expiration date and as such, they are generally priced at least as high as corresponding European options.

Black-Scholes model is derived from a partial differential equation which is used to track pricing of the option over time. This sample is implementing European options and its formula is mentioned here - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black%E2%80%93Scholes#Black.E2.80.93Scholes_formula.
